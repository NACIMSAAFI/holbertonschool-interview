## Introduction

The Sandpiles project involves simulating and analyzing sandpiles, a classic problem in computational algorithms. The goal is to understand how sand is distributed across a grid based on certain rules.


### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compiled on: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Compiler: `gcc 4.8.4` with the following flags:
  - `-Wall`
  - `-Werror`
  - `-Wextra`
  - `-pedantic`
- All files must end with a new line.
- Code should adhere to the **Betty style** and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Global variables** are not allowed.
- A maximum of **5 functions** per file.
  
### Additional Information
- The `main.c` files shown in examples are for testing only. Do not push your own `main.c` files to the repository.
- All function prototypes should be included in the header file called `sandpiles.h`.
- Ensure all header files are include guarded.
