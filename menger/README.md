# 🧩 Menger Sponge Project

Hey there! Welcome to my **Menger Sponge** project, part of the **C#22 Interview Preparation - Algorithms** curriculum. This was a really fun challenge that pushed my skills in algorithms and recursion, and I can’t wait to share it with you.

## 🚀 What’s This Project About?

In this project, I implemented a program that generates a **Menger Sponge** – it’s a super cool 3D fractal. Imagine a cube that keeps getting smaller cubes removed from it in a recursive pattern. It’s like a mind-bending Lego block with a bunch of holes punched through it. It looks simple at first, but the deeper you go, the more complex and fascinating it becomes!

This project was guided by **Alexandre Gautier**, a software engineer at Holberton School. It’s rated as a level 1 (Amateur) project, so it’s a great way to get hands-on with some neat algorithmic concepts.


## 🛠️ Project Requirements

Here’s what I had to follow to make sure everything runs smoothly:

* **Editors**: I used `vi`, but you can also use `vim` or `emacs`.
* **Environment**: The code is compiled on **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS**.
* **Compiler**: I used `gcc 4.8.4` with these flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`.
* **Betty Style**: I followed the Betty coding style guidelines, checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`. It’s all about clean and readable code.
* **New Line**: All files end with a new line – it’s a little thing, but it matters!
* **No Global Variables**: I kept everything local for better structure and readability.
* **Function Limit**: No more than 5 functions per file, which helped keep the code modular and easy to manage.
* **Testing**: I wrote my own `main.c` files for testing, but only pushed the necessary code. The project’s own `main.c` files are used for final compilation.
* **Header File**: All function prototypes are included in `menger.h`.
* **Header Guards**: I used include guards to prevent double inclusions.

## 📂 Project Structure

Here’s how I organized everything:

* The main header file is named `menger.h`, which includes all the function prototypes.
* The source files contain the actual implementation.
* I used **include guards** in the header files to avoid any issues with multiple inclusions.

## 🌱 How to Try It Out

If you want to check it out yourself, here’s how you can get started:

**Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NACIMSAAFI/holbertonschool-interview/menger.git
   cd menger
