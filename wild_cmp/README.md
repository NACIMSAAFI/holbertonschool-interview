This project focuses on implementing a function that compares two strings, where one string can contain the special character `*`. The `*` can replace any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence). The function returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise `0`.

## Description

The goal of this project is to write a function `wildcmp` that compares two strings (`s1` and `s2`). The string `s2` can contain the special character `*`, which can match any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence). The function should return `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise `0`.
