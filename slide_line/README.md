# 2048 (Single Line)

## üìú Description

This project is a simplified implementation of the **2048 game mechanics** applied to a single horizontal line of integers. Given an array of integers, the task is to **slide** and **merge** the array to the left or right, following the rules of the 2048 game. The project is part of the interview preparation curriculum at **Holberton School**, focusing on algorithms and problem-solving skills.

## üìù Requirements

- All code is compiled on **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS** using `gcc` with the following flags:
  - `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`
- Code follows the **Betty coding style** guidelines.
- No use of **global variables**.
- No more than **5 functions** per file.
- **Dynamic memory allocation** (e.g., `malloc`, `calloc`) is not allowed.
- Function prototypes are declared in `slide_line.h`, which includes include guards.
