# Curriculum
## [C#22] Interview Preparation - Algorithms

---

### Description
This project focuses on preparing for technical interviews with a strong emphasis on algorithmic problem-solving. The aim is to build a solid foundation in algorithms, enabling candidates to tackle common coding challenges effectively.

---

### Requirements
#### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS**
- Programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the following flags:
  - `-Wall`
  - `-Werror`
  - `-Wextra`
  - `-pedantic`

---

### Coding Standards
- All files should end with a **new line**.
- Code should adhere to the **Betty style**. 
  - Style will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Global variables** are not allowed.
- No more than **5 functions** per file.

---

### Usage
- Example `main.c` files are provided for testing purposes. 
  - You are not required to push these files to your repository.
  - The compilation will use provided main files, which may differ from examples.
  
---

### Function Prototypes
- All function prototypes must be included in a header file named `lists.h`.
- Ensure to **push your header file** to the repository.
- All header files should be **include guarded** to prevent multiple inclusions.
