# ðŸŒ€ Linked List Palindrome

Welcome to my **Linked List Palindrome** project! ðŸš€ This is part of my interview preparation journey in the Holberton School curriculum, specifically focused on algorithms.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a function that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards. In this case, weâ€™re extending the concept to linked lists. ðŸ¤“

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

To successfully complete this project, I adhered to the following guidelines:

- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation**: All files will be compiled on **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS** using:
  ```bash
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
