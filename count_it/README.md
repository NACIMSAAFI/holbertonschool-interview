# Count it!

Welcome to the **Count it!** project! üöÄ This is part of the Holberton School's Interview Preparation curriculum under the [C#22] track for Algorithms. In this project, I explore querying the Reddit API to perform specific tasks while adhering to Python best practices.

---

## üìñ Description

The project focuses on using Python to interact with the Reddit API. The main goal is to retrieve and process data from Reddit, working within the constraints of real-world API usage. Key features include:

- **Using the Requests library** for sending HTTP requests.
- **Organizing imports alphabetically** in all Python files.
- Writing clean, **PEP 8-compliant** code.
- Providing **module-level documentation** to enhance code clarity and maintainability.

This project serves as a hands-on opportunity to practice handling APIs, writing efficient algorithms, and preparing for technical interviews.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To complete this project, the following requirements must be met:

- **Environment**: All code is tested and executed on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3).
- **File Structure**:
  - All files must start with the shebang `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - Code should be structured to pass `wc` length checks.
- **Code Style**: Follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide.
- **Modules**: Each Python module must have documentation (run `python3 -c 'print(__import__("module_name").__doc__)'` to test).
- **Libraries**: The only external library allowed is [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/).
- **Execution**: Ensure all scripts are executable.
